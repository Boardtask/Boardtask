# CSS Formatting Rules

To maintain the consistency and performance of the Boardtask Utility CSS Framework, follow these formatting rules:

1.  **Utility Classes**: All utility classes MUST be on a single line.
    -   **Correct**: `.p-1 { padding: 0.25rem; }`
    -   **Incorrect**:
        ```css
        .p-1 {
          padding: 0.25rem;
        }
        ```

2.  **Collapsed Format**: For custom components, maintain the "collapsed" format where possible to reduce file size and improve scannability of the large utility file.

3.  **Spacing & Indentation**:
    -   Use **2 spaces** for indentation.
    -   One space after the selector and before the opening brace `{`.
    -   Rules with **4 properties or less** should be on a **single line**: `.btn { padding: 0.5rem; color: white; border: none; cursor: pointer; }`
    -   Rules with **more than 4 properties** should be **multi-line**:
        ```css
        .side-drawer {
          position: absolute;
          top: 57px;
          ...
        }
        ```
    -   Semicolon `;` after every property.

4.  **No Mass Reformatting**: Do NOT use automated tools that expand every single-property utility class into multi-lines.

5.  **Minimize White Lines**: Do NOT include blank lines between rules. The file should be compact.
