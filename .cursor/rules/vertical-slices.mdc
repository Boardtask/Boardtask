# Vertical Slice Architecture

The application uses **vertical architecture** with three distinct areas, each organized by feature slices:

- **site** — Marketing website (landing pages, home, about). Already implemented with `site/home.rs`.
- **docs** — Documentation section (planned for future).
- **app** — Authenticated dashboard area: login, features, projects. Structure: `app/features/{auth,projects,...}` and `app/db` for app-specific models.

Each feature slice contains its own routes, handlers, templates, and database queries.
