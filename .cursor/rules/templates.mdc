# Colocated Templates

HTML templates live beside their Rust code. This keeps each feature slice self-contained:

- `src/base.html` — shared layout (at the root)
- `src/site/home.html` — colocated with `src/site/home.rs`
- `src/app/features/auth/signup.html` — colocated with `src/app/features/auth/signup.rs`
- `src/app/features/auth/login.html` — colocated with `src/app/features/auth/login.rs`

Template paths in Rust use relative paths from Askama's `dirs`:

```rust
#[derive(Template)]
#[template(path = "site/home.html")]
pub struct HomeTemplate {
    pub app_name: &'static str,
}
```

Askama compiles templates into the binary at build time, so template errors are caught during compilation.

Reference [askama.toml](../askama.toml): `dirs = ["src", "src/app/features/auth", "src/site"]`
