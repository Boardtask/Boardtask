# Testing and Verification

To quickly test the application with a verified account, follow these steps:

### 1. Sign Up
Go to [https://boardtask.local/signup](https://boardtask.local/signup) and create a test account.
- **Example Email**: `test@example.com`
- **Example Password**: `Password123`

### 2. Retrieve Verification Token
The application sends a verification email, but in development, you can grab the token directly from the SQLite database.
Run this command in your terminal:
```bash
sqlite3 boardtask.db "SELECT token FROM email_verification_tokens LIMIT 1;"
```

### 3. Verify Email Manually
Copy the token returned by the query and visit the verification URL in your browser:
`https://boardtask.local/verify-email?token=<TOKEN>`

*(Replace `<TOKEN>` with the string you copied from the database)*

### 4. Verification Success
Upon visiting the URL, your account will be marked as verified, and you will be automatically logged in and redirected to the dashboard.
